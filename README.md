# Arduino-Projects
Some of the projects I have done in Arduino for fun and to help with the Robots for Fun summer camp

-- these files are in C but do not #include any libraries because they are intended to be placed into the Arduino IDE
-- simply copy and paste the code into a BareMinimum sketch
-- since the BareMinimum sketch already contains the functions setup() and loop(), you can clear the entire sketch and paste my code as is, or you can copy the code underneath these aforementioned functions and paste it under the respective function.
